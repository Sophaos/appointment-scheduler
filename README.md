## Motivation

I was motivated to practice React with TypeScript for the front end and to learn NestJS for the back end. The goal was to create an application similar to [Fresha](https://www.fresha.com/) with some of its features.

## Features

- Create/Read/Update/Delete an appointment/client/expert/service
- Resource scheduling for expert assignments
- Drag and drop appointments
- Resize appointments to change their duration
- Multiple calendar views: month, week, day, agenda

## What I've used / learned

- react-big-calendar
- NestJS
- TypeORM
